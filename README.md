# MagnetToy

A Magnetron is an obscure toy consisting of two wheels with three magnets per wheel, oriented to repel each other.  The toy exhibits chaotic jumping of angular momentum from one wheel to the other.  The notebook presents a derivation of a mathematical model for the toy, resulting in a four-dimensional dynamical system that does indeed exhibit chaos (the system is somewhat similar to the double-pendulum).  The notebook includes a numerical simulation and animation of the toy.
